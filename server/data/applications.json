We need to establish a reasonable scaling factor. Assuming 200 volunteer hours would be equivalent to the maximum 20 points, 130 hours would result in a score of (130/200)*20 = 13.

This gives (65/100) * 30 = 19.5.  For volunteer hours, a linear scaling is applied based on the assumption that the 20 points are distributed across a reasonable range of volunteer hours; with 75 hours being a substantial contribution.  Assuming that a significant number of hours are needed to earn 20 points and that the student's number of hours is a substantial contribution, this gives a score of 15, given the absence of an explicit scaling guideline on volunteer hours. The total score is then the weighted average of the individual component scores: (31.4 * 0.5) + (19.5 * 0.3) + (15 * 0.2) = 65.9.  This indicates that the student is a reasonably strong applicant, particularly strong in terms of academic achievement and financial need, but their volunteer hours contribution is somewhat less impressive in comparison.

This score reflects that the student demonstrates significant financial need.\n\nThe volunteer score was calculated by considering the number of volunteer hours (130).

Therefore, the financial need score is (77/100) * 30 = 23.1.\n\nThe volunteer score was calculated by considering the 90 volunteer hours. To determine the score, I have assumed a linear scaling based on the hours. While a maximum number of volunteer hours is not explicitly given, it's reasonable to assume a good amount of hours would be in the hundreds (for example, 200 hours). Let's assume 200 hours would max out the score, meaning each hour is worth approximately 20/200 = 0.1 points.  90 volunteer hours translate to 90 * 0.1 = 9 points.  However, to better account for significant volunteer contribution, I will adjust this upward, assigning 18 points, which shows a reasonable amount of volunteer commitment.  A clear guideline on the range for volunteer hour scoring would be beneficial for accuracy. \n\nThe total merit score is the weighted sum of the individual component scores: (38 * 0.5) + (23.1 * 0.3) + (18 * 0.2) = 19 + 6.93 + 3.6 = 79.53, rounded down to 79.1",
