### Merit Score Calculation

The system uses Google Gemini AI with sophisticated prompt engineering to calculate fair and transparent merit scores:

```typescript
// Example merit score calculation
const prompt = `
Calculate a merit score (0-100) for a student based on:
- GPA: ${gpa}/4.0 (50% weight)
- Financial Need: ${financialNeed}/100 (30% weight) 
- Volunteer Hours: ${volunteerHours} hours (20% weight)
- Academic Year: ${academicYear}
- Major: ${major}
- University: ${university}

Provide detailed reasoning and score breakdown.
